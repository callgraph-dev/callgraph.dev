# callgraph.dev

![Demo](https://marketing.callgraph.dev/export-type-hierarchy-2.gif)

A vscode extension to visualize relationships in your codebase.

## Motivation

How do you know which file to open first in a new codebase?
Which file should your new function be defined in? Will other
engineers be able to find your new function?

These code structure questions are hard to answer without
a deep understanding of the codebase. It's nearly impossible
to know the first time you open a codebase. And its still hard
the tenth or hundreth time.

The callgraph.dev extension attempts to make this easier.
